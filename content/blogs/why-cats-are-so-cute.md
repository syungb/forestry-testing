## Ddeok who?

Here comes Ddeok, my first cat! he's about 11-12 years old, and a beautiful tuxedo cat. We adopted him from a friend's friend, who had found him on the street on one random winter evening, Ddeok followed the person all the way to her home. He seemed being able to use a litter box, so she tried to find an owner for three weeks, then had no luck unfortunately. Then we saw a Ddeok's 'for adoption' post on facebook one day, and brought him home.

## what does Ddeok like?

Ddeok really likes chicken breast..
